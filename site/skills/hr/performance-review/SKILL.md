  Structure a performance review with self-assessment, manager template, and calibration prep. Use
  when review season kicks off and you need a self-assessment template, writing a manager review
  for a direct report, prepping rating distributions and promotion cases for calibration, or
  turning vague feedback into specific behavioral examples. Do NOT use for compensation decisions
  (use comp-analysis), PIP initiation, or termination processes.

## If Connectors Available

If **~~HRIS** is connected:
- Pull prior review history and goal tracking data
- Pre-populate employee details and current role information

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Pull completed work and contributions for the review period
- Reference specific tickets and project milestones as evidence

## Tips

1. **Be specific** — "Great job" isn't feedback. "You reduced deploy time 40% by implementing the new CI pipeline" is.
2. **Balance positive and constructive** — Both are essential. Neither should be a surprise.
3. **Focus on behaviors, not personality** — "Your documentation has been incomplete" vs. "You're careless."
4. **Make development actionable** — "Improve communication" is vague. "Present at the next team all-hands" is actionable.
