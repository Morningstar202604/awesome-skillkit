  This skill should be used when the user asks to "design system architecture", do architecture review, tech selection, write an architecture decision record (ADR), do a system design review, split microservices, "evaluate microservices vs monolith", "create architecture diagrams", "analyze dependencies", "choose a database", "plan for scalability", "make technical decisions", or "review system design". Use for architecture decision records (ADRs), tech stack evaluation, system design reviews, dependency analysis, and generating architecture diagrams in Mermaid, PlantUML, or ASCII format. Also triggers on a system design review. Do NOT use for writing detailed implementation code (output stays at architecture level).

# Senior Architect

Architecture design and analysis: generate architecture diagrams (Mermaid/PlantUML/ASCII), analyze dependency coupling and circular references, evaluate project structure, and walk the decision workflow (database, patterns, monolith vs microservices) — output stays at the architecture level; it doesn't write implementation code.

## Input Checklist

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Project directory | Yes | Path to the project to analyze, e.g. `./my-project` |
| Task intent | Yes | One of: draw a diagram / dependency analysis / architecture evaluation / tech selection / review |
| Diagram type | Required when drawing | component / layer / deployment |
| Output format | No | mermaid (default) / plantuml / ascii; analysis report optionally json |

When inputs are missing, ask for all at once: "Please provide: (1) project directory; (2) what to do this time (diagram / dependency analysis / architecture evaluation / selection / review); (3) if drawing, the diagram type and format."

## Pre-flight Checks

Run line by line; on any failure → fix per the remediation and STOP:

```bash
# 1. Python 3 is available
python3 --version
# Expected: Python 3.8+.

# 2. All three tool scripts exist
ls scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py scripts/dependency_analyzer.py scripts/project_architect.py
# Expected: all three filenames (run inside the skill directory). On failure: cd to the skill directory; still missing → STOP and report.

# 3. The target project directory exists
ls <project directory> > /dev/null && echo OK
# Expected: OK. On failure: confirm the path with the user, STOP.
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate the architecture diagram

```bash
python3 scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py examples/sample-project --format mermaid --type component   # bundled sample project; swap in your project root for a real one
# PlantUML:   --format plantuml --type layer
# ASCII:      --format ascii
# Save to file: --output architecture.md (or -o)
```

- **Action**: generate a diagram from the project structure, type `component` (module relationships) / `layer` (layering) / `deployment` (deployment topology).
- **Expected**: stdout emits diagram code in the corresponding format; Mermaid output is recognizable by keywords like `graph TD`.
- **On failure**: empty output or error → the project directory has no source files; confirm the directory with the user, then STOP.

### Step 2: Dependency analysis

```bash
python3 scripts/dependency_analyzer.py examples/sample-project --output json
# Circular deps only: --check circular
# Detailed mode with suggestions: --verbose
```

- **Action**: resolve direct and transitive dependencies, inter-module circular deps, a coupling score (0-100), and outdated packages; supports npm/yarn, requirements.txt/pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml.
- **Expected**: the report contains CIRCULAR/OUTDATED entries and Recommendations (or a clean report with no problems).
- **On failure**: an unsupported package manager → report "this stack isn't in the supported list", STOP; JSON can't be parsed → rerun in `--verbose` text mode.

### Step 3: Architecture evaluation

```bash
python3 scripts/project_architect.py examples/sample-project --verbose
# Layering violations only: --check layers
```

- **Action**: detect architecture patterns (MVC/layered/hexagonal/microservices metrics and confidence), god classes, mixed concerns, layering violations, and missing components.
- **Expected**: the report contains the detected pattern + confidence + layering-check results + Recommendations.
- **On failure**: no pattern detected → the project is too small or non-typical; report the low confidence honestly and don't fabricate conclusions.

### Step 4: Decision workflow (pick one by intent)

**Database selection**:
1. Score by data characteristics: structured + relational / needs ACID → SQL; flexible schema / document / time-series → NoSQL.
2. Scale: <1M records, single region → PostgreSQL/MySQL; 1M-100M, read-heavy → PostgreSQL + read replicas; >100M, globally distributed → CockroachDB/Spanner/DynamoDB; high write throughput >10K/sec → Cassandra/ScyllaDB.
3. Consistency: strong consistency → SQL or CockroachDB; eventual consistency acceptable → DynamoDB/Cassandra/MongoDB.
4. Record in an ADR: context, alternatives, the decision and rationale, accepted trade-offs.

**Architecture-pattern selection**: a 1-3 person team → modular monolith; 4-10 people → modular monolith or service-oriented; 10+ people → consider microservices. Independent deployment required → microservices; complex domain logic → DDD; extreme read/write ratio → CQRS; audit trail needed → Event Sourcing; many third-party integrations → Hexagonal.

**Monolith vs Microservices**: team <10 people, unclear domain boundaries, need fast iteration, shared libraries acceptable → monolith. Teams can own features end to end, must deploy independently, components have different scaling needs, clear domain boundaries → microservices. Default to starting from a modular monolith, and split into services only when module scaling needs differ significantly / teams need independent deployment / tech-stack constraints force separation.

- **Expected**: produce a clear recommendation + rationale (citing the above criteria), captured as an ADR.
- **On failure**: criteria conflict (e.g. small team but independent deployment required) → list the conflict and ask the user to set priorities, STOP.

### Step 5: Aggregate and deliver

- **Action**: aggregate the diagram, dependency analysis, evaluation, and decision into one review report; attach a file/module location to each finding.
- **Expected**: the report cites the real raw output of each tool (scores, confidence, entries) and contains no speculation.
- **On failure**: a tool has no result → mark "N/A — tool produced no output" in the report; don't fabricate.

## Parameter Cheat Sheet

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--format` | mermaid / plantuml / ascii | Diagram output format (diagram generator) |
| `--type` | component / layer / deployment | Diagram type |
| `--output` | file path | Write to a file; defaults to stdout (diagram generator) |
| `--output` | human / json | Report format (dependency_analyzer / project_architect) |
| `--check` | diagram: n/a; analyzer: all/circular/coupling; architect: all/pattern/layers/code | Run a single check only |
| `--verbose` | boolean | Detailed mode, including suggestions |
| `--json` | boolean | Machine-readable output (diagram generator) |
| `--save` | file path | Save report to file (analyzer / architect) |

## Failure Handling Table

| Symptom / error code | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `unrecognized arguments` | A parameter spelling/value isn't in the cheat sheet | Correct it against `--help` output |
| Diagram output empty | The project directory has no analyzable source | Confirm the directory contains code and rerun |
| Dependency analysis reports an unsupported stack | The package manager isn't in the supported list | Report the limitation honestly, STOP |
| Pattern-detection confidence < 50% | The project structure is non-typical | Report the low confidence and list the detected clues; don't force a conclusion |
| `FileNotFoundError` | Not running in the skill directory | `cd` to the skill directory or use absolute script paths |

## Delivery Criteria

- Definition of success: the artifacts matching the intent are all present (diagram code / dependency report / evaluation report / ADR), and every conclusion traces back to a tool output or the criteria table.
- Artifact naming: diagram `architecture.md` (or what `--output` specifies); ADR `adr-NNN-<slug>.md`.
- Save location: project-root `docs/` or a user-specified directory; delivered in-conversation by default.
- Completeness verification: the Mermaid/PlantUML code parses in the corresponding renderer (spot-check with `npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i in.mmd -o out.svg`); the ADR contains all four elements: context/alternatives/decision/trade-offs.
