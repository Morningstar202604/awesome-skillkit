# drive +upload

> **PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gws-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules. If missing, run `gws generate-skills` to create it.

Upload a file with automatic metadata

## Usage

```bash
gws drive +upload <file>
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `<file>` | ✓ | — | Path to file to upload |
| `--parent` | — | — | Parent folder ID |
| `--name` | — | — | Target filename (defaults to source filename) |

## Examples

```bash
gws drive +upload ./report.pdf
gws drive +upload ./report.pdf --parent FOLDER_ID
gws drive +upload ./data.csv --name 'Sales Data.csv'
```

## Tips

- MIME type is detected automatically.
- Filename is inferred from the local path unless --name is given.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a **write** command — confirm with the user before executing.
